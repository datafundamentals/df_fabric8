# df_fabric8 cookbook
This cookbook, with everything setup, installs and configures fuse fabric8 on your machine. You still need to get in and turn it on manually, but otherwise it seems to work well.
# Requirements
This cookbook requires you to install and set Java up for the system, or it won't know what to use. Java 1.6 is needed as a minimum
# Usage
I still have no idea what this is going to be used by, but I am sure it has something to do with Camel which is important
# Attributes

# Recipes

* default: installs from a local binary repository
* set_fabric8_home: writes a shell script to set the path and home
